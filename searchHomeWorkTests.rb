#/**
#  * This class contains the test given as homework.
#  * NOTE:
#  * 1. Tested for keywords but results will vary depending on the localization:
#  *  a. "boomerang" - passed
#  *  b. "cat" - failed because one of the BING results is "Muzeum Sztuki i Techniki JapoÅ„skiej Manggha"
#  *      that is missing "cat" from elements
#  *  c. "chloroplast" - passed
#  *  d. They still fail sometimes, so please execute at least twice until you see expected behavior
#  *  e. The number of common links varies from execution to execution
#  *      - For Firefox "chloroplast" had one common element
#  *      - For Chrome "chloroplast" had two common elements
#  *---------------------------------------------------------------
#  * 2. Implemented implicit wait 10 seconds because it is fast fix for small test. Would implement conditional wait usually.
#  * Reasons:
#  *  a. when switching from google to bing and from chrome to firefox it took longer to load the page so I added and raised wait
#  *  b. conditional wait is best, but it makes code more complicated and prone to duplication of wait code or major change to classes
#  *---------------------------------------------------------------
#  * 3. The test was implemented with driver executables in "resources" package
#  * BUT it can be executed with external chromedriver.exe and firefoxdriver.exe:
#  *  a. Supported by my Chrome(111.0.5563.111) and Firefox(111.0.1) versions.
#  *  b. Please download and extract proper chromedriver for you at desired location:
#  *      ex. C:\ChromeDriver\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe
#  *      AND
#  *      change path in property webdriver.chrome.driver in DriverFactory class
#  *  c. Please download and extract proper firefoxdriver for you at location:
#  *      C:\FirefoxDriver\geckodriver.exe
#  *      AND
#  *      change path in property webdriver.gecko.driver in DriverFactory class
#  *---------------------------------------------------------------
#  * 4. Firefox has a bug that impacts the Google search button clickability: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1374283
#  *  a. So I found a workaround with sendKey(Keys.ENTER) that works for both browsers;
#  *  b. but implemented the workaround to trigger only for Firefox;
#  *  c. I believe there was another workaround by refreshing the page, but it is bad code
